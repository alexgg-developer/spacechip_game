Video game experience has to be fluid and engaging. For that reason, performance is very
important. Can you list and describe what strategies can be used to optimize and improve
performance of a mobile game? It can be related with GPU, CPU, rendering, I/O operations,
concurrency, compression algorithms, animations, assets, etc. For every technique you think of,
provide an explanation of how it works.


-Data oriented approach

Use a game engine with a data oriented approach. Data oriented engines make better use of memory caches that 
in modern hardware is one of the main bottlenecks. The idea is to provide data layout in a way that is more 
efficient, normally using arrays to take advantage of contiguous memory. In contrast with object oriented that 
the focus is in providing data types abstractions here the focus is into pass the data to transform.

-Binary formats

Where possible use binary formats to save the data in contrast with text formats. Binary formats are faster to use than 
parsing a text format. 

-Batching

In order to reduce the communication between CPU and GPU(drawcalls) we can use batching of meshes with the same materials.
API graphics use draw calls to send information like meshes that are in main memory to gpu memory, instead of sending each 
information separetely, increasing the information that it is send each frame, we can group meshes to be more efficient in 
this aspect.

-Use of LOD (level of detail).

Depending on how big is going to be seen an object from the current point of view, we can swap meshes with a great number of polygons 
for other alternatives with less dynamically or use smaller textures.

-Control polygon count of the assets.

In general for mobile it is desirable to use meshes with a low number of polygons. You can try to optmize meshes too.

-Fragment shaders

Control the complexity of the calculations in the fragment shaders. 
Fragment shaders are going to be executed for each cantididate pixel rendered in the screen so it is important not to have complex calculations, 
for example using a simpler light model.

-Use of compressed audio (mp3).

-Minimize audio clips active at the same time.
